### 📏 **Moore’s Law**

> **"The number of transistors on a chip doubles every 18–24 months, making computers faster and cheaper."**
### 🔑 **Key Points:**

* Proposed by **Gordon Moore** in **1965**.
* Predicts **exponential growth** in computing power.
* Drove progress in **VLSI, processors, and electronics**.
* **Slowing down** today due to physical and quantum limits.

### 📉 **Current Status:**

* Nearing limits of silicon (\~2–3nm).
* Shift to **3D chips**, **chiplets**, and **new materials**.

Summary:
VLSI marked the era where chips had thousands to millions of transistors.

ULSI is the evolution of VLSI, pushing integration to billions of transistors with advanced fabrication nodes and smaller geometries.

Both fall under the broader umbrella of LSI (Large-Scale Integration) evolution.

**NMOS (N-type MOSFET)**

* **Stands for:** N-channel Metal Oxide Semiconductor

* **Turns ON:** When **positive voltage** is applied to the gate

* **Conducts:** Electrons (high mobility)

* **Key Points:**

  * Faster than PMOS (electrons move faster)
  * Used in **pull-down networks** in CMOS design


**PMOS (P-type MOSFET)**

* **Stands for:** P-channel Metal Oxide Semiconductor

* **Turns ON:** When **negative voltage** (or 0V in CMOS) is applied to the gate

* **Conducts:** Holes (lower mobility)

* **Key Points:**

  * Slower than NMOS
  * Used in **pull-up networks** in CMOS design

**CMOS (Complementary MOS)**

* **Stands for:** Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor
* **Built Using:** Both NMOS and PMOS transistors
* **Power Efficient:** Only consumes power during switching
* **High Noise Immunity**
* **Example: CMOS Inverter**

  * PMOS on top (pulls output HIGH)

### 🔍 **Definition:**

> **Threshold voltage (Vₜ)** is the **minimum gate voltage** at which a strong inversion layer forms at the interface between the oxide and the substrate in a MOSFET, allowing current to flow from **drain to source**.

---

### ⚙️ **Types of MOSFETs and Vₜ:**

| Type     | Condition to Turn ON         | Vₜ Value (approx) |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **NMOS** | $V_{GS} > V_{th}$            | \~0.2V to 0.7V    |
| **PMOS** | $V_{GS} < V_{th}$ (negative) | \~ -0.2V to -0.7V |

---

### 📐 **Equation (Simplified for NMOS):**

$$
V_{th} = V_{FB} + 2\phi_F + \frac{\sqrt{2q\varepsilon_s N_A (2\phi_F)}}{C_{ox}}
$$

Where:

* $V_{FB}$: Flat-band voltage
* $\phi_F$: Fermi potential
* $\varepsilon_s$: Permittivity of substrate
* $N_A$: Doping concentration of p-type substrate
* $C_{ox}$: Oxide capacitance per unit area

---

### 📊 **Importance in VLSI Design:**

* **Speed vs Power tradeoff**:
  Lower $V_{th}$ → Faster switching → Higher leakage power
  Higher $V_{th}$ → Lower leakage → Slower operation

* **Multi-Threshold CMOS (MTCMOS)** techniques are used to **balance power and performance**.

* Affects:

  * Static and dynamic power
  * Leakage current
  * Noise margin
  * Short channel effects in modern submicron technologies

---

### 🧠 **Advanced Concepts:**

* **Body effect**: Threshold voltage varies with source-bulk voltage.
* **Short-channel effects** (SCEs): In deep submicron tech, $V_{th}$ decreases as channel length reduces.
* **VT tuning**: Designers can tweak doping or use adaptive body biasing to optimize $V_{th}$.
