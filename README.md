### 📏 **Moore’s Law**

> **"The number of transistors on a chip doubles every 18–24 months, making computers faster and cheaper."**
### 🔑 **Key Points:**

* Proposed by **Gordon Moore** in **1965**.
* Predicts **exponential growth** in computing power.
* Drove progress in **VLSI, processors, and electronics**.
* **Slowing down** today due to physical and quantum limits.

### 📉 **Current Status:**

* Nearing limits of silicon (\~2–3nm).
* Shift to **3D chips**, **chiplets**, and **new materials**.
